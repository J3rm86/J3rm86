## 🤖 Fun Fact 🚀  

**NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts are still running code from 1977!** 🛰️  
The Voyagers, which have traveled beyond the solar system, use only **69.63 KB** of memory to store their software—less than the size of a single JPEG image! They are programmed in **Assembly language** to make the most of their limited hardware, and engineers still send updates from Earth, over 14 billion miles away.
